# Project Statement
When Edwin Drake drilled the first well in Titusville over 160 years ago, there’s no way he could
have anticipated the weight and influence it would hold in modern society!
Gasoline remains one of the most heavily consumed fuels in the United States and is the primary
output of domestic oil refineries. According to the 2020 U.S. Census, approximately 92% of
American households own at least one vehicle, underscoring the country’s deeply ingrained car
culture. Even with the surge in electric-vehicle adoption, fully electric cars made up less than 10%
of new-vehicle sales in Q1 2025, meaning more than 9 out of 10 vehicles still rely on gasoline for at
least part of their power.
Given that car travel will continue to dominate U.S. transportation for the foreseeable future,
understanding the behavior of gasoline prices remains economically and politically significant. With
the wealth of available data, can we better anticipate these shifts, and more importantly,
understand their ripple effects across the economy?
